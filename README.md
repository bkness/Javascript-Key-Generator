With my third week of javascript under way, this is a showcase on some of the skills ive learened and implemented. I have been able to create variables and arrays, then create a choice based on user prompts with an alert if the values werent met. I then made if statements to create several several brackets to store users choice. we then take the users choice and generate the password based on the arrays given.

Here is a screenshot and a working deployed link
